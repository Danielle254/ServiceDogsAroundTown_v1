# Service Dogs Around Town - Version 1

This is the first iteration of a project to help service dog handlers to remember key accessibility points as it relates to the safety and comfort of their service dogs when visiting local businesses. In this version, users manually enter the information captured below via a form. The app then displays a list of their saved entries, which can be sorted and filtered. These entries are saved in local storage.

This is meant to be a single-user, private application, meaning data is not shared between users. Future versions will have this functionality added. (see planning document linked below)

## Data points captured per entry include:

* Business Name (text)
* Location (text)
* Date Visited (date)
* Personal Note (text area)
* Favorite (boolean)
